# **`Introduction to Java`**

## **Why Java?**

- One to the most popular programming language because of its Object Oriented Nature. 
- Wide Range of usages
  - Web-Apps
  - Backend
  - Mobile Apps
  - Enterprise Software
- Rich APIs 
- Strong Community Support

## **What is a Programming Language?**

It's a way to communicate with the machines by giving instructions line-by-line. These instructions are called Code. Compiler converts high level instructions to low level instructions so that machine can read, interpret or compiled those codes and gives appropriate outputs. 

## **What is an algorithms?**

There is no specific definition of an algorithms. It simply means : The instructions or the steps that we write to accomplish a task can be called as an algorithms(with appropriate syntax).

## **History of Java**

- Developed by "James Gosling at Sun Microsystems"
- Early Originally named 'Oak'; later renamed "Java(Iceland)".
- First Release : 1995 
- Principle : "Write Once, Run Anywhere"
- Backward Compatibility

## **Magic of Byte Code**

Instead of converting high level code into machine code Java takes a different approach. What it does: It converts the code into Byte code that can run on every single machine with the help of "Java Virtual Machine". The JVM(Java Virtual Machine) converts those bytes code into machine code so that our code can run anywhere and we don't need to worry about the type of machine and its configurations, like:- their OS, CPU Architecture, etc. 

Here, compiler converts the source code into byte code which is not readable. At this stage compiler does these following tasks for us:

- Error Checking
- Code Validation
- Converts into intermediate state which can't be readable

JVM(can be different for different-different machines) takes the byte code and run it on that particular machine. 

## **Advantages**

- Portability with "Write Once Run Anywhere"
- Security because of Code running on Virtual Machine
- Java is robust(strong/consistently) due to its 
  - Strong Memory Management
  - Exception Handling
  - Type-Checking Mechanisms
  - **Multithreading** :: In Programming it is the ability of a CPU to execute multiple threads concurrently allowing for more efficient processing and task management.
  - Architecturally Neutral
  - Interpreted and High Performance
  - **Distributed** :: Java is inherently distributed, designed to facilitate network-based application development and interaction.
  - Prevent System Crashes
  - Ensuring reliable performance
  - **Object Oriented Programming** :: We write our instructions based on the object's properties and their appropriate actions, like: what it can do? What is he allowed to do?, etc.
